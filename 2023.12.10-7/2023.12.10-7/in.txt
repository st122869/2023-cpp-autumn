My alarm clock goes crazy when I sleep.
She doesn't understand that I don't love
Waking up early in the morning can be difficult for me.
Those first few minutes are a disaster.
I do not want to get up, give me 5 minutes.
You I big hug, it'll have to wait.
We're not going to torture my mobile on silent.
Not available yet.
 
Open your eyes, sleeping beauty.
Kiss me, because we like it.
In memory my this night will remain.
Too bad it was a dream.
You Wake-Wake-Wake, while the twist curler,
Work by nine, why did I turn you on?
You Wake-Wake-Wake, while the twist curler,
School's at nine, and you have to go.
You Wake-Wake-Wake, while the twist curler,
Work by nine, why did I turn you on?
You Wake-Wake-Wake, while the twist curler,
School's at nine, and you have to go.
